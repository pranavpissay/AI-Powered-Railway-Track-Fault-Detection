# AI-Powered Railway Track Fault Detection  
A MATLAB-based image processing project to detect cracks and anomalies in railway tracks for preventive maintenance.

## 🚆 Overview  
This project uses computer vision techniques to scan images of railway tracks and detect structural faults such as cracks, gaps, or misalignments. It aims to enhance railway safety by enabling early fault detection through automation.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- MATLAB  
- Image Processing Toolbox  
- Computer Vision Concepts  
- Data Preprocessing

## 🧠 Key Features  
- Detects visible cracks and gaps in track images  
- Thresholding and morphological operations  
- Region segmentation and bounding box display  
- Designed for railway infrastructure inspection automation

## 📊 Output  
- Fault regions are highlighted using bounding boxes  
- Visual output helps in identifying fault-prone areas  
- Can be scaled to live camera feed integration
